# This script uses the psutil library to monitor the CPU and memory usage of the
# system and the mysql.connector library to connect to the MySQL database. It also
# defines two functions: get_system_stats() to get the CPU and memory usage, and
# get_slow_queries() to get a list of slow queries (queries that take more than
# 10 seconds to execute).

# The script then runs a loop for one hour, checking the system stats and slow
# queries every 10 seconds. If any slow queries are found, they are printed to the
# console.After the loop is finished, the database connection is closed.

# You can modify this script to add more performance monitoring tasks,
# such as monitoring disk usage, identifying frequently executed queries,
# and optimizing database indexes.#
