# MySQL Scripts
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for working with MySQL databases. Scripts include data backup, migration, analysis, cleaning, import, user management, and performance monitoring.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MySQL server

## Pre-requisites
Make sure that you have MySQL installed on your system and that the `mysqldump` command is available in your PATH environment variable.

You can test this by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `mysqldump`. If it returns an error message, then you need to add the directory containing 'mysqldump' to your PATH environment variable.

If you are on Windows, you can add the directory to your `PATH` by following these steps:

Open the Start menu and search for `Environment Variables`
- Click on `Edit the system environment variables`
- Click on the `Environment Variables` button
- Under `System Variables`, find the `Path` variable and click `Edit`
- Click `New` and add the directory containing `mysqldump` (e.g. C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin)
- Click `OK` on all open windows to save the changes.

If you are on Linux, you can add the directory to your PATH by adding the following line to your .bashrc file:
    `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/mysql/bin`
